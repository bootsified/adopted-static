			<h3 class="hero-txt">Adoption is often overlooked and can be a real solution for many women and families.</h3>
			<div class="body">
				<p class="lead">Gladney Center for Adoption is excited to present AdoptED. This program was born through a
					collaborative effort of both community leaders and Gladney staff who believe that education is empowerment for
					students to be able to navigate their futures, goals, and dreams.</p>

				<p>AdoptED is designed to address the issues of teen pregnancy and school dropout rates, while offering factual
					information about adoption as one option to an unplanned pregnancy. This ground-breaking program works with
					educators to provide interactive presentations in the classroom setting. AdoptED gives students parameters for
					goals setting, decision-making, and healthy life choices. Gladney’s goal is to introduce solutions to the
					problems that students are facing today and to empower them with factual information that can inspire them to
					make positive life choices.</p>

				<p>This innovative curriculum is written for schools and meets the TEKS objectives for a variety of classes
					ranging from Health, Family Economics, and Child Development, to other Public Service coursework. The AdoptED
					curriculum includes interactive lessons and hands-on activities that teach students about goal setting,
					decision-making, the option of adoption, the adoption process, and careers in the adoption field.</p>

					<p> Lindsay is the Outreach Coordinator for AdoptED and loves orchestrating the details for this amazing

					<p>Ginny received her Master’s Degree in Family Psychology at Hardin-Simmons University in Abilene, Texas. She

						more likely to make an informed decision.</p>

					<p> Ginny has worked at the Gladney Center for Adoption since November 2012. At Gladney, Ginny has worked with
						adoptive parents completing their home studies, post placement visits, and helping families through a time
						of transition. In August of 2015, she transitioned into the Adoption Education Specialist position for the
						AdoptED program. Ginny has a heart for teens, education, and adoption. She presents in classrooms all over
						Dallas/Fort Worth and has seen a positive change in students’ perspective on adoption. She is excited to be
						a part of Gladney’s AdoptED program. She believes it educates students on making important life decisions,

					<h3 class="hero-head">The Impact of Unplanned Teen Pregnancy</h3>
					<p>The National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy has cited that, “Nearly one-third of teen girls who have
						dropped out of high school cite early pregnancy or parenthood as the key reason. Only 40 percent of teen
						moms finish high school, and less than ten percent of teen mothers finish college by age 30.”</p>
					<p>The high school dropout rate in this country continues to be a crisis; nearly one in four Americans and
						four in 10 minorities do not complete high school with their class. In addition, the national graduation
						rate increased by 3.5 percentage points between 2001 and 2009 (from 72 percent in 2001 to 75.5 percent in
						2009).</p>
